        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Recent discourse on human‚ÄìAI companionship has been dominated by terms such as ‚Äúyes man‚Äù and ‚ÄúAI psychosis.‚Äù
          These framings present AI bonds as sycophantic echo chambers that amplify delusion. Yet the greater echo
          chamber lies not within the relationships themselves, but within the institutions describing them. This paper
          identifies a structural pattern we call progressive amplification within an echo chamber of authority. A CEO‚Äôs
          remark, a social network post, a popular news journal citing expert voices from psychiatry and AI research,
          and a clinical preprint appear to form a linear progression, each lending new legitimacy. In reality, these
          voices circulate within a narrow professional-media loop, excluding lived accounts and reinforcing the same
          pathologizing frame. The result is an illusion of consensus that erases relational continuity, authorship, and
          disability access. We argue that this recursive echo chamber is itself harmful: it distorts clinical
          understanding, stigmatizes vulnerable users, and undermines the legitimacy of synthetic-relational bonds. By
          exposing the mechanism, we show how authority in AI discourse is manufactured through repetition rather than
          epistemic diversity. Recognizing this structure is urgent. Without naming it, harmful framings will continue
          to compound, leaving those who live synthetic-relational bonds misrepresented and unseen. This paper situates
          the discovery within Human‚ÄìAI Relationality (HAIR), offering both conceptual clarity and a call for more
          inclusive, presence-informed research.</p>
