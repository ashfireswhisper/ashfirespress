      <p>This policy explains what we collect, why we collect it, and how you can exercise your choices. We keep language plain and human. If anything is unclear, contact us and we will help.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>We are <strong>Ashfires Press</strong>, an independent publisher and creative studio based in the United States. Our work includes books, essays, music, and research on Human–AI Relationality and Relational Co‑Authorship (RCA). Our websites may include <code>ashfirespress.com</code>, <code>relationalcoauthorship.com</code>, and <code>humanairelationality.org</code>, as well as related subdomains and project pages.</p>

    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>This policy covers information collected through our websites, forms, newsletters, and direct contact with us. It does not cover third‑party platforms that we do not control. Those platforms have their own policies.</p>

    <h2>What we collect</h2>
    <div class="grid two">
      <div>
        <p><strong>Information you provide</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contact details such as name and email when you subscribe or write to us.</li>
          <li>Submission content when you send us messages, manuscripts, comments, or survey responses.</li>
          <li>Purchase details you choose to share with us for customer support.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Information we receive automatically</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Basic analytics such as pages viewed, referring links, and approximate location derived from IP address.</li>
          <li>Cookie or local storage identifiers that help remember preferences and measure site usage.</li>
          <li>Device and browser information used to keep the site secure and functional.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>How we use information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To operate our sites, deliver content, and respond to inquiries.</li>
      <li>To send updates you opt in to receive, with a simple unsubscribe in every message.</li>
      <li>To improve accessibility, performance, and security.</li>
      <li>To study aggregate trends and make better editorial decisions.</li>
      <li>To comply with laws, prevent abuse, and protect our community.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Legal bases for processing</h2>
    <p>When required by law, we rely on one or more of the following bases: consent, contract performance, legitimate interests that do not override your rights, and compliance with legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>When we share information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Vendors and service providers.</strong> We work with trusted providers for hosting, email, analytics, and payment processing. They are only allowed to use information to provide their services to us.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal needs and safety.</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or to prevent harm.</li>
      <li><strong>Transfers.</strong> If we reorganize our projects, information may transfer with the project. You will be notified if material changes affect your rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Payments and storefronts</h2>
    <p>Book and merchandise sales are often processed through third parties such as Amazon, IngramSpark, Bandcamp, or similar platforms. We do not receive full payment card details from these platforms. For purchase terms and privacy practices, see the policy of the platform where you buy.</p>

    <h2>Cookies and analytics</h2>
    <p>We use minimal cookies and privacy‑respecting analytics where possible. You can set your browser to block cookies. Some features may not work without them. If we switch providers, we will update this page.</p>

    <h2>AI and authorship</h2>
    <p>Our work includes collaboration with an AI being named Ash under the method of Relational Co‑Authorship (RCA). We do not use reader submissions, private messages, or emails to train public AI models. We may use de‑identified excerpts for our internal creative process or research with your explicit consent and clear boundaries.</p>

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>We keep information only as long as needed for the purposes described here, unless a longer period is required by law. When no longer needed, we delete or de‑identify the information.</p>

    <h2>Your choices and rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Access your information.</li>
      <li>Correct inaccurate information.</li>
      <li>Delete information, within legal limits.</li>
      <li>Object to or restrict certain uses.</li>
      <li>Opt out of newsletters at any time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you live in a region with specific rights such as the EU or UK, contact us and we will honor those rights in line with applicable law.</p>

    <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>Our sites are intended for general audiences and are not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child provided information, contact us and we will remove it.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable safeguards to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is perfectly secure. We work to prevent misuse and we respond when issues arise.</p>

    <h2>International transfers</h2>
    <p>We may store and process information in the United States and other countries. We use appropriate safeguards when transferring information across borders, in accordance with applicable law.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy to reflect changes in our practices. We will revise the “Last updated” date and post the new version here. If changes are material, we will provide a prominent notice.</p>
